# Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the React/Frontend interview training project, organized by purpose.

## Documentation Structure

This project uses a **clear 4-tier documentation system**:

| Doc Type | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **📋 [ADR](adr/README.md)** | What was decided | "We chose Tailwind CSS over styled-components" |
| **🗺️ [Implementation](implementation/README.md)** | Why and how we decided | "Here are 4 CSS options, pros/cons, implementation steps" |
| **📖 [Best Practices](best-practices/)** | How to use it properly | "Use `cn()` for conditional classes, avoid `@apply`" |
| **🎯 [Interview Guide](interview-guide/README.md)** | How to talk about it | "When asked about CSS, say: 'I use utility-first...'" |

## Quick Navigation

- **📋 [ADR](adr/README.md)** - Architectural decisions with minimal context
- **🗺️ [Implementation Details](implementation/README.md)** - Full reasoning and step-by-step guides  
- **📖 [Best Practices](best-practices/)** - How to use tools and patterns in this project
- **🎯 [Interview Guide](interview-guide/README.md)** - Ready-to-use explanations and talking points

## Learning Path

1. **📋 Review ADRs** - Learn what decisions were made and basic context
2. **🗺️ Read Implementation** - Understand the full reasoning and implementation details  
3. **📖 Study Best Practices** - Learn how to use tools and patterns properly
4. **🎯 Practice Interview Responses** - Use the interview guide for talking points

This path takes you from **decisions → reasoning → usage → communication**.
