# Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the React/Frontend interview training project, organized by purpose.

## Documentation Structure

This project uses a **clear 4-tier documentation system**:

| Doc Type                                         | Purpose                | Example                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[ADR](adr/README.md)**                         | What was decided       | "We chose Tailwind CSS over styled-components"            |
| **[Implementation](implementation/README.md)**   | Why and how we decided | "Here are 4 CSS options, pros/cons, implementation steps" |
| **[Best Practices](best-practices/)**            | How to use it properly | "Use `cn()` for conditional classes, avoid `@apply`"      |
| **[Interview Guide](interview-guide/README.md)** | How to talk about it   | "When asked about CSS, say: 'I use utility-first...'"     |

## Quick Navigation

- **[ADR](adr/README.md)** - Architectural decisions with minimal context
- **[Implementation Details](implementation/README.md)** - Full reasoning and step-by-step guides
- **[Best Practices](best-practices/)** - How to use tools and patterns in this project
- **[Interview Guide](interview-guide/README.md)** - Ready-to-use explanations and talking points

## Learning Path

1. **Review ADRs** - Learn what decisions were made and basic context
2. **Read Implementation** - Understand the full reasoning and implementation details
3. **Study Best Practices** - Learn how to use tools and patterns properly
4. **Practice Interview Responses** - Use the interview guide for talking points

This path takes you from **decisions → reasoning → usage → communication**.
