## How This Connects to Our Implementation

Each interview guide is based on **real decisions and implementations** in this project:

- **React Setup 2025**: Based on our [ADR-001 Build Tool](../adr/001-build-tool-choice.md) and [Journey 2a](../journey/2a-initial-project-setup.md)
- **CSS Styling**: Based on our [ADR-010 CSS Solution](../adr/010-css-styling-solution.md) and working examples in `src/examples/css-implementations/`
- **Code Quality**: Based on our [ADR-002 Code Quality](../adr/002-code-quality-tools.md) and actual Biome configuration
- **Testing**: Based on our [ADR-003 Testing](../adr/003-unit-testing-framework.md) and [ADR-004 E2E Testing](../adr/004-e2e-testing-framework.md)
- **Bundle Size**: Based on our [ADR-008 Bundle Size](../adr/008-bundle-size-budgets.md) and working CI scripts in `scripts/`

This means you can **demonstrate** what you're talking about with actual working code, not just theoretical knowledge.

## Usage

1. **Before interviews**: Review relevant topics
2. **During interviews**: Reference key talking points and show actual code
3. **After interviews**: Update based on questions asked
4. **For practice**: Use the working examples to reinforce explanations
