# Code Quality & Formatting Setup

## Introduction

This document is part of the **Project Setup Essentials** series, focusing specifically on code quality and formatting tools. While you wouldn't typically set up all these tools during an interview, understanding and being able to discuss these choices is crucial for demonstrating professional development practices.

## Available Options Analysis

### Option 1: ESLint + Prettier (Traditional)
**Tools**:
- **@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin**: TypeScript-specific linting rules
- **eslint-plugin-react**: React-specific linting rules
- **eslint-plugin-react-hooks**: Hooks-specific linting rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **eslint-config-prettier**: Disable conflicting ESLint rules

**Pros**:
- Mature ecosystem with extensive plugin support
- Industry standard - widely adopted
- Strong TypeScript integration with type-checking rules
- Comprehensive rule coverage

**Cons**:
- Requires multiple configuration files
- Potential conflicts between ESLint and Prettier
- Slower performance, especially on large codebases
- Complex setup and maintenance

### Option 2: Biome (Modern Alternative)
**Tools**:
- **Biome**: Single tool for both linting and formatting
- **biome.json**: Single configuration file

**Pros**:
- **Performance**: 25x faster than Prettier, 15x faster than ESLint
- **Simplicity**: Single tool, single config file
- **No conflicts**: Unified linting and formatting
- **97% Prettier compatibility**
- **Growing adoption**: Gaining traction in 2025

**Cons**:
- **Limited ecosystem**: No plugin support yet (coming in v2.0)
- **Missing type-checking**: Lacks comprehensive TypeScript type-based rules
- **Less mature**: Smaller community, fewer resources
- **File type limitations**: Limited support for Vue, Markdown, YAML

## Community Standards Analysis

**ESLint + Prettier**: 
- Established industry standard
- Default choice for most React projects
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Job market expects familiarity

**Biome**: 
- Emerging standard gaining momentum
- Forward-thinking teams adopting early
- Performance-focused community
- Growing but still niche

## My Decision & Reasoning

### Final Choice: Biome

**Reasoning**:
- **Performance advantage**: 25x faster formatting, 15x faster linting - significant impact on development workflow
- **Simplicity**: Single tool, single config eliminates tool conflicts and complexity
- **Personal preference**: I've been using Biome more frequently and appreciate the unified approach
- **Community standards consideration**: While ESLint + Prettier is still the majority standard, Biome is gaining serious traction in 2025

### Why I Always Check Community Standards

**Philosophy**: I consistently evaluate community standards because:
- **Job market alignment**: Understanding what teams expect and use
- **Collaboration**: Easier to work with others when using familiar tools
- **Ecosystem support**: Community-backed tools have better long-term viability
- **Knowledge transfer**: Standard approaches make onboarding and knowledge sharing easier

**Current Assessment (2025)**:
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Still the most common choice, expected knowledge for interviews
- **Biome**: Growing fast, performance-focused teams adopting early
- **Decision**: Use Biome for personal projects, but understand both approaches well

### Implementation Strategy
**Choice**: Biome for this project
**Reasoning**:
- **For this project**: Biome is easier and meets my current needs
- **For real projects**: Decision should consider:
  - Team familiarity and preferences
  - Company-wide tool standardization
  - Existing project consistency
  - Avoiding unnecessary stack complexity
  - Migration costs and team training time

**Key principle**: Tool choice should serve the team and project, not personal preference

## Interview Relevance

Being able to discuss these tools shows:
- **Professional experience**: Understanding of real-world development practices
- **Technical decision-making**: Ability to evaluate tools and make informed choices
- **Team collaboration**: Consideration of team dynamics and standardization
- **Performance awareness**: Understanding of development workflow optimization

## Implementation Process

### Biome Installation

**Installation Process:**
```bash
npm i -D -E @biomejs/biome
npx @biomejs/biome init
```

**Package Scripts Setup:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "biome check",
    "lint:fix": "biome check --fix",
    "format": "biome format --write",
    "format:check": "biome format",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

**Important Note:**
The installation uses the latest Biome package. Be careful when running Biome commands - using global installation may trigger configuration errors. Always use `npx @biomejs/biome` or npm scripts to ensure you're using the local project version.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run lint           # Check linting and formatting
npm run lint:fix       # Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run format         # Format code
npm run type-check     # TypeScript type checking
```
